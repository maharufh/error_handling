# error_handling

Explanation of Error Handling in Asynchronous Code:
Error Simulation:
The fetchUserDetails API successfully returns the user details after a 1-second delay.
The fetchUserOrderHistory API is designed to always fail (it rejects the promise) with an error message "Failed to fetch order history".
Retry Mechanism:
The retryFetchOrderHistory function takes an optional parameter maxRetries (default 3) and tries to fetch the order history.
In case of failure (i.e., the catch block is hit), it logs the error and retries the API call up to the given retry limit (3 in this case).
If all attempts fail, it throws an error, which is caught by the main try/catch block in the fetchUserData function.
Main Function (Error Handling with async/await):
The fetchUserData function uses async/await to call both APIs.
A try/catch block ensures that if any error occurs during the API calls (whether it’s the user details or order history), the error is caught and handled gracefully.
If the retryFetchOrderHistory function throws an error after all retries fail, it is handled in the final catch block, logging an appropriate message to the console.
Explanation of Why Error Handling Is Crucial in Async/Await:
1. Ensures Application Stability:

When dealing with asynchronous operations, especially API calls, errors are inevitable. For instance, network issues, server downtime, or invalid responses could cause an API to fail. If errors aren’t properly handled, they can cause the entire application to crash or behave unpredictably.
By using try/catch, we can ensure that even if something goes wrong, the error is handled gracefully and the rest of the application can continue functioning.
2. Graceful Degradation:

In scenarios where an API call fails (such as fetching the user’s order history in this example), proper error handling allows the application to notify the user of the issue or fallback to a secondary action.
Without error handling, an uncaught exception would cause the program to stop abruptly. With try/catch, we can catch the error and display a user-friendly message or retry the operation.
3. Retry Logic:

A common approach to handling transient errors (e.g., a server temporarily being down) is to retry the operation. In this example, the order history API is retried up to 3 times before the program gives up.
This is important because some errors, like network failures, may resolve themselves after a short period. Implementing retry logic can prevent a temporary issue from causing a permanent failure.
4. Error Propagation and Catching Specific Errors:

The use of try/catch with async/await ensures that errors are caught at the appropriate level in the code, and they are propagated upwards if necessary. For example, if retryFetchOrderHistory fails after 3 attempts, the error is propagated to the main fetchUserData function, where it can be logged or handled accordingly.
This pattern also allows for more granular error handling, where specific actions can be taken for certain types of errors (e.g., network errors vs. validation errors).
Use Cases for Retry Logic:
Network Requests: Retry logic is especially useful for network requests where temporary failures (e.g., connectivity issues or server overload) can be resolved by retrying.
Data Fetching: In applications that rely on external data sources, retry mechanisms help improve reliability, reducing the likelihood of failure due to transient issues.
Background Jobs: In scenarios where asynchronous jobs are run in the background (e.g., file uploads or batch data processing), retrying operations in case of failure can help ensure the task eventually completes successfully.
